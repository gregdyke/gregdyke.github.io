      Here are various ways of interpreting the bourrée "Les Lordaus de la
      Montanha", which is similar, possibly identical to "Se la Volià Chausir".
      Some of them are in better taste and some are more likely to actually turn
      up as opposed to just being "theoretical". They illustrate one way of
      thinking traditional music tune variation in Europe more widely and for
      Bourrée in Central France specifically. As usual, it's just a way of
      thinking not some kind of description of an underlying "truth" about the
      culturally appropriate ways of varying.
    </p>
    <p>The essential portions of this way of thinking are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sharing a given rhythm can be done with specific syllables (lu, labu,
        lam, laa, laaa, etc.). The use of these syllables is intended only as a
        shorthand when teaching/sharing, not as "here is how you should actually
        sing the tune".
      </li>
      <li>
        Each bar of 3 counts can be thought of as having an underlying "labu
        labu labu".
      </li>
      <li>
        The "labu labu labu" can be varied in many ways, not limited to: "lam
        lam lam", "lam laa", "laa lam", "laaa lu lalu"
      </li>
      <li>
        A large number of more or less systematic syllables can actually be used
        in interpreting the tune and its variations.
      </li>
      <li>
        The melody itself will emerge with experience, but should mostly be
        thought of as a variation on the "original" with diatonic runs, pedal
        notes, repetitions and so on, as opposed to the "jazz improvisation over
        the underlying harmony" that people often assume is universally
        applicable to all music.
      </li>
      <li>
        There is something in this way of thinking that is unique to this
        musical tradition and would be different for music from Brittany or
        Ireland, but if asked to put my finger on exactly what, I might be hard
        pressed to tell you. It might be something about how the rhythm is a
        strong identifier that differentiates some tunes from other tunes. So
        variations that depart too much towards an "other tune" might be less
        likely?
